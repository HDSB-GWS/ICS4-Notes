# Task(s)
* Complete further research on how to create a recursive function/method. There are a few examples of recursive functions in this repo.
* Create an iterative function (i.e. loops without recursion) and a recursive function to solve two out of the three problems below.
* After completing the practice, consider the following questions: 
  * What are some common pitfalls of recursion? 
  * What issues did you run into during your development of the below algorithms?

**Problem 1: Sum digits**
```
Given a non-negative integer n, return the sum of its digits.

Examples:
If you ran iterativeCalculate(126) you would get a return value of 9.
If you ran recursiveCalculate(126) you would also get a return value of 9.
```

**Problem 2: Palindromes**
```
Given a string, calculate the amount of palindromes that exist within 
that string (single letters excluded).  For example, the word "kayak"
would contain two palindromes within it ("kayak" and "aya").

A palindrome is something that can be spelled the same way forwards and 
backwards.  For example, the word "kayak" spelled backwards is still "kayak".  
Your program should not be case sensitive.  For example, "kayak", "kayAk", 
and "KAYak" would all be considered palindromes.

Examples:
If you ran iterativeCalculate("kayak") you would get a return value of 2 ("kayak" and "aya" are both palindromes).
If you ran recursiveCalculate("kayak") you would also get a return value of 2 ("kayak" and "aya" are both palindromes).
```

**Problem 3: Mirrordromes**
```
Given a string, calculate the amount of mirrordromes that 
exist within a given string (including single letter mirrors).

A mirrordrome is a word that can be mirrored if cut in half and folded over on itself.

Single letters that are considered mirrors in this program include:
i, l, m, n, o, t, u, v, w, x

Letters that are considered mirrored opposites in this program include:
b <-> d, p <-> q, s <-> z

Examples:
If you ran iterativeCalculate("dob") you would get a return value of 2 ("dob" and "o" are both mirrordromes).
If you ran recursiveCalculate("totally") you would get a return value of 7 ("t", "t", "o", "l", "l", "ll", and "tot" are all mirrordromes)
```
